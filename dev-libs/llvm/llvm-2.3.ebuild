# can be read from llvm/LICENSE.TXT in the source tarball.

# the directory llvm/runtime/GCCLibraries/libc contains a stripped down C
# library licensed under the LGPL 2.1 with some third party copyrights, see the
# two LICENCE* files in that directory.  Those parts do *not* get built, so
# we omit LGPL in ${LICENCE}
